👋 Hi, I'm Yaya traore (traoyaya09)

🎯 AI-Powered E-commerce | 🎨 Full-Stack Developer | 📊 Data Science Enthusiast

I'm an AI engineer and full-stack developer with a passion for building intelligent, user-centric e-commerce systems. My current work focuses on integrating machine learning models into real-world applications, including:

- 🧠 Personalized Product Recommendation Systems (Collaborative, Content-Based, Hybrid, Deep Learning)
- 🛍️ AI-Powered Customer Segmentation (GMM, PCA, KMeans, RFM)
- 🧾 Fraud Detection with Supervised & Unsupervised Models (XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Stacking)
- 💬 Multi-Model Sentiment Analysis (VADER, TextBlob, LightGBM, Logistic Regression)
- ⚙️ Full-Stack Web Development (React, Redux, Express, Node.js, MongoDB)
- 📈 Dashboards & Visualization (Plotly, Dash, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
